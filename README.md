# DeepFake_Detector

## Building a deepfake image detection model which is capable of classifying image into two categories Ai-Genrated or Real image using TensorFlow

# Problem Definition
* The model is used for detection of deepfake or Ai-generated images that 
  are now widly used for spreading hate speech and fake news.

# Data
* We are using Kaggle data  uploaded on the drive and will also upload     zip file on github 

# Evaluation

* Prediction Probalities should be more than 90% which is this projects goal to acheive

# Features

* Few key information abot features as the project is based on image classification which are unstructured, Thus there is no such distinctive feature but the data is divide into 3 parts . Testing,Training and Validation. and the model will be a binary classifier
